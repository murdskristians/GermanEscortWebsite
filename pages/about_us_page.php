           focuses on the future almost as much as it does the past. The company
          opens with the headline, “Our path to success.” The paragraph about
          the business is concise, and the page immediately flows into a section
          about the company culture.
          <br />
          With a culture and leadership section, The Zebra focuses on people
          creating the company rather than itself. This is a subtle shift from
          some of the other About Us pages. Approximately two-thirds of The
          Zebra’s About Us page is devoted to company culture and the leadership
          team.

            Lemonade’s About Us page is centralized around its “makers.” Through this
            messaging, the company highlights that all of its employees are
            proactively building the product and are “makers” in their own right.
            Lemonade has minimal information on its About Us page, but that’s on par
            for its branding. For example, the company uses excess white space on its
            landing pages to illustrate a pink pop dash. This page is no different.
            With only two lines of text and an illustration, Lemonade provides a
            high-level look at its company and those building it.
